# Playwright E2E Tests

This repository contains end-to-end (E2E) tests for web applications using Playwright.

## Why I Created This

I created this repository to practice automating tests for web applications. Playwright is a powerful tool for testing modern web apps across different browsers, and I wanted to learn how to write effective and maintainable tests using this framework.

The tests in this repository serve as a foundation for my knowledge and can be adapted for different projects or applications in the future.

## Features

- Browser automation with Playwright.
- Tests for critical user flows to ensure everything functions as expected.
- A clean and easy-to-understand structure for running and extending tests.
